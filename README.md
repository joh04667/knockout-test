This was my first encounter with Knockout. I am really surprised at how much I enjoy working with it! I love how lightweight it feels yet the functionality it exposes to you is awesome. I am very curious of the ways it can be implemented in a team or on an enterprise-level project.

Having said that, with Knockout being a library and not a framework, it was really difficult for me to find examples of best practices when it comes to Knockout. I took some time with this project to try out some of the cooler Knockout features like bindings and extenders and tried to write those things so they would be scalable.
