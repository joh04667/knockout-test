Instructions:

1. Implement a remove button. Remove button should appear on each row in the cart and will remove the item on that row from the cart.
2. Implement the quantity functionality. Each cart item should have a quantity. User should be able to increase/decrease the quantity of an item once it is in the cart.
3. Put in basic validations (no negative quantities, no negative or zero prices)
4. Alphabetize items within the list being shown.
5. Add a total that sums up the prices and displays that under the cart. The total should reflect any changes made to the cart including additions, deletions, or updates to quantities.
6. Clean up the aesthetics of the page without affecting functionality. Feel free to modify the HTML, use CSS, or a 3rd-party library such as Bootstrap. Make it look modern and professional.

Feel free to modify index.html or script.js in any way you feel is necessary to complete the above tasks.
